This plugin listens on a socket (either TCP or UNIX) and whenever someone sends
a message to the socket, it dumps it to a channel.  It has no commands and
requires a bit of a configuration to be useful.

Its original purpose was to parse email messages from Glympse
[http://glympse.com/] piped to it via procmail and announce the enclosed URL.
Script and sample .procmailrc for doing this are included in the archive.

Installation:

1) Copy (or link) the 'Craftoria' directory to your bot's plugin directory.

2) Configure the bot. First, set the channel (here, #mychan) to which the
   incoming messages are announced:

      !config channel #mychan supybot.plugins.Craftoria.announce on

   Next, you need to configure where will the plugin listen for the incoming
   messages. There are two possibilities: it can either use unix socket, or a
   network socket. The network socket is preferable if the machine receiving
   the email is not the same machine where the bot is running.

   Using unix socket:

      !config supybot.plugins.Craftoria.unix on
      !config supybot.plugins.Craftoria.socketFile /path/to/the/socket

   Using network socket:

      !config supybot.plugins.Craftoria.unix off
      !config supybot.plugins.Craftoria.host 0.0.0.0
      !config supybot.plugins.Craftoria.port 12345

   This will make the bot listen on all interfaces/addresses on port 12345. You
   may also want to set up a firewall so that no one else than the machine on
   which the mail is received can connect

   You have to reload the plugin to actually change those settings.

      !reload Craftoria

3) Configure the email delivery. Example procmail configuration file that
   pipes all messages from glympse.com to the msgpipe-glympse.py script which
   parses it and sends the url to the bot's socket is provided.

   You may want to adjust the paths to the script and the socket.
